Discharge Summary:

Patient Name: [INSERT NAME]
Gender: Male
Age: 29
Medical Record Number: [INSERT NUMBER]

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our outpatient clinic for a delayed diagnosis of proximal hamstring injury due to a soccer injury 3 years earlier. The patient reported previous consultations with multiple healthcare professionals with no relief of symptoms. The chief complaint was daily pain underneath the buttock, worsened by physical activity, longer walking, and while sitting. Impairment in the athlete's performance with muscle weakness of the hamstrings led to severe restrictions in daily life.

Physical examination revealed significant tenderness along the proximal hamstring tendons and at the ischial tuberosity with no palpable defect at the hamstring insertion at the ischial tuberosity. Active and passive range of motion (ROM) of hip and knee were unremarkable. An ischial tuberosity apophyseal fracture with a 7 × 3 centimeter (cm) large, displaced fragment was detected through plain radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis. Magnet resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis showed nonunion and displacement of approximately 1 cm.

Due to daily complaints, surgery was performed. Fourteen years after the initial trauma, an open excision of the large bony fragment and an open repair of the proximal hamstring tendons was performed. The patient was placed in a prone position and surgical dissection was performed. Following the excision of the fragment and debridement of local fibrous tissue, refixation of the proximal hamstring tendons was performed using 3 suture anchors at the ischial tuberosity. Postoperatively, the patient was mobilized on crutches, underwent prescribed physical therapy, and wore a hard frame hip and knee brace for 6 weeks. 

Outcome:
Ninety-four points were scored on the Perth Hamstring Assessment Tool nine months postoperatively. At 12-month postoperative follow-up the patient reported satisfaction and was able to perform normal daily activities and engage in various physical activities, including volleyball, beachvolleyball, hiking, kite-surfing, climbing, and skiing.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Proximal hamstring injury due to a soccer injury with ischial tuberosity apophyseal fracture and nonunion.

Discharge Instructions:
Follow up with the outpatient clinic as scheduled. No weight-bearing activity for six weeks following surgery. Continue crutches use for six weeks from the date of discharge. Wear the prescribed hard frame hip and knee brace for six weeks. Follow the prescribed physical therapy program.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 53-year-old woman, presented to our institution with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Abdominal examination was concerning for significant epigastric tenderness in the right upper quadrant and left lower quadrant. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a large amount of simple-appearing free fluid within the abdomen and mucosal edema throughout the small bowel.

Diagnosis:

Angioedema of the small bowel, secondary to lisinopril usage, was the more likely diagnosis.

Treatment:

Lisinopril was discontinued, after which the patient started improving clinically with diminution of symptoms. The patient’s hypertension was treated with amlodipine.

Follow-Up:

At the two-week outpatient follow-up, the patient had been symptom-free and continued to do well.

Final Diagnosis:

Angioedema of the small bowel, secondary to lisinopril usage, with normal C1-inhibitor and serum C4 level.

Discharge Summary:

Hospital Course:
A 66-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a maculopapular skin rash that gradually progressed to involve all the extremities with generalized pruritus. She reported loss of appetite and weight loss in the last month. The patient was diagnosed with mastocytosis and primary pulmonary involvement in extra-nodal marginal zone lymphoma of MALT origin (MALT lymphoma). The patient's skin rash and pruritus resolved spontaneously over the course of the next six weeks. More tests and exams were performed to evaluate systemic involvement in mastocytosis and assess associated hematologic and solid organ malignancies. The patient had a video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection of the largest solid lung nodule.

Hospital Course:
The 51-year-old female patient had a CT scan which revealed a 13 cm mass in the left perirenal space with multiple lymphadenopathy in the left para-aortic space. The patient underwent ultrasonography-guided biopsy of the mass which appeared to be a benign lymphoproliferative lesion. Mass excision was performed which included the left kidney and the enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes without residual masses. Pathological examination confirmed that the lesion was Castleman Disease (hyaline-vascular type) involving the perinephric and paraaortic lymph nodes. 

Follow-Up:
Regular follow-up was conducted with abdominopelvic CT scans and after a disease-free state of 52 months, multiple enlarged lymph nodes were found in follow-up CT scans. A three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was performed which resulted in a partial response with decrease of lymph node size less than 1 cm. On follow-up CT scans 12 months after radiotherapy, the patient had no evidence of disease. 

Discharge Summary:
1. Diagnosis:
The patient was found to have Castleman Disease (hyaline-vascular type) involving the perinephric and paraaortic lymph nodes. 

2. Hospital Course:
The patient underwent mass excision which included the left kidney and the enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes without residual masses. Follow-up was conducted regularly with abdominalpelvic CT scans.

3. Follow-Up:
There was a disease-free state after the mass excision for 52 months but multiple enlarged lymph nodes were found on follow-up CT scans. Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was performed resulting in a partial response with decrease of lymph node size less than 1 cm. There was no evidence of disease on follow-up CT scans 12 months after radiotherapy. 

4. Medications:
No medications were prescribed at discharge.

Discharge Summary:

Patient Name: N/A
Age: 70 years
Sex: Male

Chief Complaint:
SCA (Sudden Cardiac Arrest) with typical chest pain

History of Present Illness:
The patient, a 70-year-old male, presented at the emergency room in December 2011 with SCA and typical chest pain. The electrocardiogram conducted after cardiopulmonary resuscitation showed ST elevation in the anterior leads. The patient had a previous history of coronary risk factors, including hypertension, smoking, and diabetes, and had undergone CABG 4 years ago in another hospital.

Hospital Course:
After the SCA, the patient was promptly referred to the catheterization room for primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The initial physical examination revealed absent pulses in both upper and lower extremities. A blind-puncture at the left brachial artery was performed to conduct coronary angiography, but the 035"" hydrophilic soft terumo wire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) did not pass the LSCA. The transbrachial peripheral angiography showed a total occlusion of LSCA, but the graft from the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) was patent. After passing 014"" guide wire (Pilot, Abbott, Santa, Clara, CA, USA) through the lesion, the LSCA was progressively dilated by a 2.0×20 balloon (Lacrosse, Goodman Medical Ireland Ltd., Galway, Ireland) inflated at 16 atm and a 4.0×20 mm balloon (Lacrosse, Goodman Medical Ireland Ltd., Galway, Ireland) at 18 atm. A 7.0×24 mm stent (Coroflex Blue, Braun Vascular Systems, Berlin, Germany) was deployed at the LSCA. Transbrachial coronary angiography showed three vessels with CAD presenting significant atherosclerotic stenosis of proximal LAD, major obtuse marginal artery, and mid-right coronary artery. The peripheral angiography showed total occlusion of the right common iliac artery and left external iliac artery. Due to the patient's unstable vital signs, an attempt was made to insert the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) via the left brachial artery, which was successfully located in the descending thoracic aorta. However, the IABP was not operating properly and had to be removed. The patient was stabilized with medical treatment after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) but, unfortunately, had sequela of ischemic brain damage.

Conclusion:
The patient was diagnosed with Sudden Cardiac Arrest with typical chest pain and had a previous medical history of hypertension, smoking, and diabetes. The patient had undergone CABG 4 years ago. The treatment involved percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) after which the patient was stabilized but had sequela of ischemic brain damage.
