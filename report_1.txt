Hospital Course:

The patient, a 53-year-old woman, presented to our institution with abdominal pain and diarrhea. Abdominal examination was concerning for significant epigastric tenderness in the right upper quadrant and left lower quadrant. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a large amount of simple-appearing free fluid within the abdomen and mucosal edema throughout the small bowel.

Diagnosis:

Angioedema of the small bowel, secondary to lisinopril usage, was the more likely diagnosis.

Treatment:

Lisinopril was discontinued, after which the patient started improving clinically with diminution of symptoms. The patientâ€™s hypertension was treated with amlodipine.

Follow-Up:

At the two-week outpatient follow-up, the patient had been symptom-free and continued to do well.

Final Diagnosis:

Angioedema of the small bowel, secondary to lisinopril usage, with normal C1-inhibitor and serum C4 level.
