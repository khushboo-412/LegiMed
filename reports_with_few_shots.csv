Discharge Summary:

Patient Name: [INSERT NAME]
Gender: Male
Age: 29
Medical Record Number: [INSERT NUMBER]

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our outpatient clinic for a delayed diagnosis of proximal hamstring injury due to a soccer injury 3 years earlier. The patient reported previous consultations with multiple healthcare professionals with no relief of symptoms. The chief complaint was daily pain underneath the buttock, worsened by physical activity, longer walking, and while sitting. Impairment in the athlete's performance with muscle weakness of the hamstrings led to severe restrictions in daily life.

Physical examination revealed significant tenderness along the proximal hamstring tendons and at the ischial tuberosity with no palpable defect at the hamstring insertion at the ischial tuberosity. Active and passive range of motion (ROM) of hip and knee were unremarkable. An ischial tuberosity apophyseal fracture with a 7 × 3 centimeter (cm) large, displaced fragment was detected through plain radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of the pelvis. Magnet resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis showed nonunion and displacement of approximately 1 cm.

Due to daily complaints, surgery was performed. Fourteen years after the initial trauma, an open excision of the large bony fragment and an open repair of the proximal hamstring tendons was performed. The patient was placed in a prone position and surgical dissection was performed. Following the excision of the fragment and debridement of local fibrous tissue, refixation of the proximal hamstring tendons was performed using 3 suture anchors at the ischial tuberosity. Postoperatively, the patient was mobilized on crutches, underwent prescribed physical therapy, and wore a hard frame hip and knee brace for 6 weeks. 

Outcome:
Ninety-four points were scored on the Perth Hamstring Assessment Tool nine months postoperatively. At 12-month postoperative follow-up the patient reported satisfaction and was able to perform normal daily activities and engage in various physical activities, including volleyball, beachvolleyball, hiking, kite-surfing, climbing, and skiing.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Proximal hamstring injury due to a soccer injury with ischial tuberosity apophyseal fracture and nonunion.

Discharge Instructions:
Follow up with the outpatient clinic as scheduled. No weight-bearing activity for six weeks following surgery. Continue crutches use for six weeks from the date of discharge. Wear the prescribed hard frame hip and knee brace for six weeks. Follow the prescribed physical therapy program.

    Few-Shot Examples: Example: The patient was diagnosed with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB and was treated empirically with INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, moxifloxacin, and amikacin, and pyridoxine was also given. The patient responded well to treatment and could walk without a walker with a stable upright gait six months later.

Example: The reason for the patient's admission was for evaluation of chronic pain over his pacemaker site. The patient's chronic pain was treated by extraction and re-implantation of the PPM on the contralateral side, with a new dual-chamber PPM system being implanted on the left side and anchored to the pectoral muscle with a three-point fixation. The generator was first placed in a CanGaroo envelope soaked in an antibiotic solution containing neomycin and polymyxin B. The patient's right-sided discomfort immediately decreased post-operatively, with no device movement or significant symptoms related to the left-sided PPM system over a six-week follow-up period.

Example: The patient was diagnosed with Graves' disease and methimazole-induced agranulocytosis, and was treated with plasma exchange and filgrastim to improve WBC and neutrophil counts. Thyroidectomy was performed, and the patient received calcium carbonate for hypocalcemia postoperatively. The patient was started on Levothyroxine for postsurgical hypothyroidism, and was stable on discharge with plans for continued monitoring and management with the endocrine clinic.

Example: The patient presented with left eye corneal abscess due to accidental insect contact, which was managed with a therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty followed by topical steroids and antibiotics. The patient's vision improved to 6/60 at 2 weeks postoperatively and is being closely monitored for cataract progression during regular follow-up visits. The healthcare provider instructed to continue using prescribed medication, keep the eye clean, and attend follow-up appointments.

Example: The patient was diagnosed with acute decompensated heart failure in the context of dilated cardiomyopathy. She was initially treated with a combination of pharmacological agents, but due to lack of response, her therapy was changed to valsartan/sacubitril, resulting in significant improvement in just 5 days. She was discharged and followed up as an outpatient, where her LVEF continued to improve and remained in a stable condition with Modified Ross/NYHA I status. The medications prescribed on discharge were valsartan/sacubitril, bisoprolol, spironolactone, and furosemide.

Example: The patient underwent SP shunting for persistent cranial pseudomeningocele. Following the shunt insertion, the pseudomeningocele was successfully relieved. However, six months later, the patient presented with scalp swelling and headaches due to a migrated and coiled shunt catheter under the scalp. The shunt catheter was removed, and the dura was covered with a subgaleal flap to prevent CSF leak. Post-operation,",Summary not found.,"followed by a concise summary for legal professionals. 

    Please note that I will be using the following terminology: 
    - ""Empiric treatment"" refers to the use of antibiotics or other medications without a specific diagnosis, but based on the patient's symptoms and presentation.
    - ""Supportive measures"" refers to treatments aimed at managing symptoms and maintaining the patient's overall health, such as fluid management, pain control, and nutritional support.
    - ""Thrombocytopenia"" refers to a low platelet count.

A 66-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a maculopapular skin rash that gradually progressed to involve all the extremities with generalized pruritus. She reported loss of appetite and weight loss in the last month. The patient was diagnosed with mastocytosis and primary pulmonary involvement in extra-nodal marginal zone lymphoma of MALT origin (MALT lymphoma). The patient's skin rash and pruritus resolved spontaneously over the course of the next six weeks. More tests and exams were performed to evaluate systemic involvement in mastocytosis and assess associated hematologic and solid organ malignancies. The patient had a video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge resection of the largest solid lung nodule. Repeat CT chest at six and 12 months after resection failed to show any evidence of recurrence or metastasis, and the patient continued to be symptom-free.

[Discharge Summary Begin]
Hospital Course:
The 51-year-old female patient had a CT scan which revealed a 13 cm mass in the left perirenal space with multiple lymphadenopathy in the left para-aortic space. The patient underwent ultrasonography-guided biopsy of the mass which appeared to be a benign lymphoproliferative lesion. Mass excision was performed which included the left kidney and the enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes without residual masses. Pathological examination confirmed that the lesion was Castleman Disease (hyaline-vascular type) involving the perinephric and paraaortic lymph nodes. 

Follow-Up:
Regular follow-up was conducted with abdominopelvic CT scans and after a disease-free state of 52 months, multiple enlarged lymph nodes were found in follow-up CT scans. A three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was performed which resulted in a partial response with decrease of lymph node size less than 1 cm. On follow-up CT scans 12 months after radiotherapy, the patient had no evidence of disease.

Hospital Course:
The 65-year-old male patient presented with drug-refractory, symptomatic atrial arrhythmias and underwent a pace-and-ablate strategy. A biventricular pacemaker was implanted with a coronary venous LV lead, which had to be deactivated due to positional phrenic nerve stimulation. This led to the recurrence of heart failure. An LV endocardial lead was successfully placed transatrially, but the patient presented with worsening breathlessness after 9 months. TOE showed severe mitral regurgitation with tethering of the posterior mitral valve leaflet to the LV lead. The LV lead was consequently removed and a new LV lead was implanted via the coronary sinus.

Discharge Summary:
The patient presented with atrial arrhythmias and underwent several procedures, including the implantation of a biventricular pacemaker with a coronary venous LV lead, and subsequently transatrial placement of an LV endocardial lead.

5. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TOE) showed severe mitral regurgitation with tethering of the posterior mitral valve leaflet to the LV lead.
6. As a result, the LV lead was removed, and a new LV lead was implanted via the coronary sinus.

**Summary:**
For legal professionals, the patient's hospital course can be summarized as follows: The patient underwent multiple procedures to manage atrial arrhythmias, including the implantation of a biventricular pacemaker and subsequent LV lead placement. However, the patient experienced worsening symptoms and severe mitral regurgitation due to the LV lead's tethering to the mitral valve leaflet. The LV lead was removed and replaced with a new one via the coronary sinus, resulting in a good clinical response at 6 months follow-up. The patient's treatment and outcomes are a testament to the importance of careful consideration and adaptation in the management of complex cardiovascular conditions. 

**Response to Instruction:**
Here is a concise summary of the patient's hospital course, including the procedures performed and the reason for LV lead removal:

The patient underwent a pace-and-ablate strategy for atrial arrhythmias, involving the implantation of a biventricular pacemaker with a coronary venous LV lead.

Discharge Summary:

Patient Name: N/A
Age: 70 years
Sex: Male

Chief Complaint:
SCA (Sudden Cardiac Arrest) with typical chest pain

History of Present Illness:
The patient, a 70-year-old male, presented at the emergency room in December 2011 with SCA and typical chest pain. The electrocardiogram conducted after cardiopulmonary resuscitation showed ST elevation in the anterior leads. The patient had a previous history of coronary risk factors, including hypertension, smoking, and diabetes, and had undergone CABG 4 years ago in another hospital.

Hospital Course:
After the SCA, the patient was promptly referred to the catheterization room for primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The initial physical examination revealed absent pulses in both upper and lower extremities. A blind-puncture at the left brachial artery was performed to conduct coronary angiography, but the 035"" hydrophilic soft terumo wire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) did not pass the LSCA. The transbrachial peripheral angiography showed a total occlusion of LSCA, but the graft from the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) was patent. After passing 014"" guide wire (Pilot, Abbott, Santa, Clara, CA, USA) through the lesion, the LSCA was progressively dilated by a 2.0×20 balloon (Lacrosse, Goodman Medical Ireland Ltd., Galway, Ireland) inflated at 16 atm and a 4.0×20 mm balloon (Lacrosse, Goodman Medical Ireland Ltd., Galway, Ireland) at 18 atm. A 7.0×24 mm stent (Coroflex Blue, Braun Vascular Systems, Berlin, Germany) was deployed at the LSCA. Transbrachial coronary angiography showed three vessels with CAD presenting significant atherosclerotic stenosis of proximal LAD, major obtuse marginal artery, and mid-right coronary artery. The peripheral angiography showed total occlusion of the right common iliac artery and left external iliac artery. Due to the patient's unstable vital signs, an attempt was made to insert the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) via the left brachial artery, which was successfully located in the descending thoracic aorta. However, the IABP was not operating properly and had to be removed. The patient was stabilized with medical treatment after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) but, unfortunately, had sequela of ischemic brain damage.

Conclusion:
The patient was diagnosed with Sudden Cardiac Arrest with typical chest pain and had a previous medical history of hypertension, smoking, and diabetes. The patient had undergone CABG 4 years ago. The treatment involved percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) after which the patient was stabilized but had sequela of ischemic brain damage.
