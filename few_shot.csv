Hospital Course:

The patient presented with difficulty walking and experiencing ascending paresthesia from the chest down to both her feet with progressive asymmetrical weakness in her right hand and both lower extremities over a period of two months. The patient was employed at a group home, denied any constitutional or pulmonary symptoms, and had no history of TB or exposure but did receive bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine as a child.

The patient's physical exam revealed upper and lower limb muscle strength of 5/5 bilaterally, normal tone and deep tendon reflexes, no sensory impairment, and cautious gait. An MRI of the cervical spine revealed an epidural mass at C6-T1 on the left side of the spinal canal with severe cord compression. Neurosurgery was consulted, and the patient underwent decompressive laminectomy with segmental fixation, revealing a fleshy, gray, rubbery mass found outside the dura between spinal levels C5-T1.

Biopsy revealed no evidence of malignant cells, but instead showed granulomatous inflammation with rare acid-fast organisms identified on acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain. Quantiferon TB was positive. AFB cultures showed no growth.

The patient was diagnosed with multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, treated empirically with INH, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, moxifloxacin, and amikacin, and pyridoxine was also given. The patient responded well to treatment and could walk without a walker with a stable upright gait six months later.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 65-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and aortic stenosis, was admitted for evaluation of chronic pain over his pacemaker (PPM) site. He had previously undergone a bioprosthetic aortic valve procedure, complicated by complete heart block requiring dual-chamber PPM implantation on the right side. The patient reported persistent discomfort at the PPM site, with an ability to flip the device around the X and Z axes, along with device migration and rotation within the pocket.

Clinical Findings:
On examination, the generator was mobile and easily rotated around the single suture, with reproducible pain during generator movement. There were no signs of active infection at the site.

Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the electrophysiology laboratory for PPM extraction and re-implantation on the contralateral side. Intra-operatively, the device was found to be anchored to the pectoral muscle with no clear evidence of pocket infection. The generator and leads were extracted from the vasculature with simple traction. A new dual-chamber PPM system was implanted on the left side via the left axillary vein and persistent left SVC, and anchored to the pectoral muscle with a three-point fixation to prevent all movement within the pocket. The generator was first placed in a CanGaroo® envelope soaked in an antibiotic solution containing neomycin and polymyxin B.

Outcome:
Post-operatively, the patient's right-sided discomfort immediately decreased, and there has been no device movement or significant symptoms related to the left-sided PPM system over a six-week follow-up period.

Diagnosis: Acute decompensated heart failure (HF) in the context of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with severe HF and was treated with a combination of pharmacological agents including furosemide, ramipril, bisoprolol, spironolactone, dopamine, and milrinone. Despite the administration of these drugs, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and she developed cardiomegaly with pleural effusion. Given the lack of response to conventional medications, her therapy was changed to an angiotensin receptor–neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), valsartan/sacubitril, started at a dose of 0.8 mg/kg/dose twice daily. She demonstrated significant improvement within the first 5 days of treatment, with a rapid decline in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and increased urine output. Pleural effusion and cardiomegaly subsequently subsided. She was discharged after 17 days and followed up as an outpatient. Her LVEF improved (from 19.5% to 56.5%) over time, and her clinical status significantly improved to Modified Ross/New York Heart Association (NYHA) I. 

Patient follow-up:
The patient was given regular follow-up care in our outpatient clinic, and she did not experience any further adverse effects related to her treatment with valsartan/sacubitril. Her LVEF continued to improve, and she remained in a stable condition with Modified Ross/NYHA I status.

Medications on Discharge:
valsartan/sacubitril, bisoprolol, spironolactone, furosemide

Discharge date: [date]

Reason for admission: Craniectomy and duraplasty with artificial dura due to an infected compound depressed skull fracture

Synopsis: 

The patient was admitted for a craniectomy and duraplasty with artificial dura due to an infected compound depressed skull fracture. Eighteen months later, the patient underwent cranioplasty using methylmetacrylate for the skull defect which crossed the sagittal suture line. Following this procedure, the patient experienced leakage of cerebrospinal fluid into the subgaleal space of the scalp, leading to progressive scalp growth. Conservative treatments like direct aspiration of the CSF followed by compression with an elastic bandage and continuous lumbar drainage were not effective. The patient underwent SP shunting for persistent cranial pseudomeningocele. Two short catheters were placed into the subgaleal space and connected to a distal catheter using a Y-shaped rigid connector without any valve systems. The cranial shunt catheter was anchored at the level of the connector. 

Hospital Course:

Following the SP shunt, the pseudomeningocele was relieved. The patient was discharged and advised regular follow-up. However, six months later, the patient presented with scalp swelling and headaches. On examination and simple X-ray of the skull, a migrated and coiled shunt catheter was revealed under the scalp. The entire shunt catheter was removed, and the dura was covered with a subgaleal flap to prevent CSF leak. Post-operation, the subgaleal CSF collection disappeared, and the patient is currently doing well without further complications.

Follow-up Care:

The patient was discharged from the hospital with instructions to follow-up for routine neurosurgical appointments and ensure that there were no further episodes of cerebral spinal fluid leakage. The patient was instructed to contact the neurosurgical team immediately in case of any complications.
